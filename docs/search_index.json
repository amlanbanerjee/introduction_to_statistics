The chapter introduces various data types, sampling techniques, sampling errors, two main types of statistical studies, namely observational studies and experiments. Also discussed here are their benefits and drawbacks and how to design them well. 2.1 What is Statistics? The science of planning studies and experiments; obtaining data; and organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data and then drawing conclusions based on them. Application of statistics is literally everywhere - business, finance, engineering, health science, social science, environmental science, politics, education, and so on. 2.2 Statistical Thinking Statistical studies are designed by the following five steps: Raise a precise question about one or more variables. Will the COVID vaccine be effective on children (ages &lt; 5 years)? Design a plan to answer the question. Construct a theory or hypothesis based on existing knowledge, say laboratory experiments, or similar studies in the past. Who will be recruited to the clinical trial (target population)? What kind of data needs to be collected (age, sex, medical history, etc.)? How the data will be collected (sampling methods)? How the privacy of the participants will be protected? Collect the data. Analyze the data. Analyze the data to test your theory or hypothesis. Draw a conclusion from the data about the question and communicate the results with the stakeholders. Definitions Data are collections of observations, such as measurements or survey responses. Variable is a characteristics of the individuals to be measured or observed. Population is the complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered. Typically, a population is the complete collection of data that we would like to make inference about. Census is the collection of data from every member of the population. Sampling Frame is a numbered list of all the individuals in the population from which a sample is drawn. Sample is a sub-collection of members selected from a population. Population Parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristics of a population. Sample Statistic is a numerical measurement describing some characteristics of a sample. Example (parameter vs. statistic): There are \\(17,246,372\\) high school students in the U.S. In a study of \\(8505\\) U.S. high school students \\(16\\) years of age or older, \\(44.5\\%\\) of them said that they texted while driving at least once during the previous \\(30\\) days. Parameter: What percent of the population texted while driving? (unknown) Statistic: \\(44.5\\%\\) 2.3 Types of Data or Variable 1) Categorical (or Qualitative) - consist of names or labels (not numbers that represent counts or measurements) Levels of Measurement of Qualitative Data - Nominal (unordered): the data fall into categories that have no particular order or ranking in relation to each other, e.g., color (blue, green, red,), gender (male, female), nationality (American, Canadian, Mexican,) - Ordinal (ordered): values have a natural order to ranking, but differences either cant be found or are meaningless e.g., temperature (low, medium, high), exam grade (A, B, C, D, F), satisfaction (high, neutral, low) 2) Numerical (or Quantitative) - consist of numbers representing measurements or counts. - Continuous: a subject or observation takes a value from an interval of real numbers, e.g., weight, height, age, etc. Continuous (numerical) data result from infinitely many possible quantitative values, where the collection of values is not countable, such as the lengths of distances from \\(0\\) inch to \\(12\\) inch. - Discrete: a subject or observation takes certain values from a finite set, e.g. population, traffic volume, etc. Discrete data result when values are quantitative and the number of values is finite, or countable, such as the number of tosses of a coin before getting tails. Levels of Measurement of Quantitative Data Interval Variables: these variables are measured along a continuum, and they have the property that equal differences between measures represent equal differences in the values of the variable. Therefore, differences are meaningful, but there is no natural zero starting point at which none of the quantity is present and ratios are meaningless. For example, temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. So the difference between \\(20^\\circ C\\) and \\(30^\\circ C\\) is the same as \\(30^\\circ C\\) to \\(40^\\circ C\\). However, \\(0^\\circ C\\) does not mean there is no temperature. Also, \\(\\dfrac{40^\\circ C}{20^\\circ C} = 2\\) does not mean \\(40^\\circ C\\) is twice the warmer than \\(20^\\circ C\\). Similarly the years 2021 and when you were born, say 1981, can be arranged in order, and the difference of \\(40\\) years can be found and is meaningful. However, time did not begin in year \\(0\\), so the year \\(0\\) is arbitrary instead of being a natural zero starting point representing no time. Ratio Variables: these variables have all the properties of interval variables, but in addition have the property that there is a natural zero starting point (where zero indicates that none of the quantity is present) and the ratios make sense. Examples of ratio variables include height, mass, distance, time etc. The name ratio reflects the fact that you can use the ratio of measurements. So, for example, a distance of \\(10\\) meters is twice the distance of \\(5\\) meters, and the measurement of distance starts at \\(0\\). 2.4 Sampling Methods Sampling from a Population Because populations are often very large, a common objective of the use of statistics is to obtain data from a sample and then use those data to form a conclusion about the population. Example: Identify the Variable, Sample, and Population of a Study In a poll of \\(1000\\) randomly selected American adults, \\(48\\%\\) of respondents said that they strongly disapprove of the way Congress is doing its job. The study then made an inference about all American adults. Define the variable of the study. Identify the sample. Identify the population. 2.4.1 Simple Random Sampling (SRS) A simple random sample of \\(n\\) subjects is selected in such a way that every possible sample of the sample size \\(n\\) has the same chance of being chosen. In statistics a sample of a population is said to be random if each member in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. Sampling with replacement - an individual is selected more than once. Sampling without replacement - an individual is selected only once. Source: OpenIntro.Org 2.4.2 Stratified Sampling The population is divided into non-overlapping, homogeneous subgroups called strata . Then, SRS is employed to select a certain number or a certain proportion of the whole within each stratum. Source: OpenIntro.Org Example: Stratified Sampling (Optional) Design a sample to survey \\(500\\) students using stratified sampling method. \\[ \\text { Strata Sizes } \\bbox[white,4px] { \\color{black} { \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\text{Gender} &amp; \\text{Undergraduate} &amp; \\text{Graduate} &amp; \\text{Total} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Female} &amp; \\text{3355} &amp; \\text{4693} &amp; \\text{8048} \\\\ \\text{Male} &amp; \\text{3734} &amp; \\text{6687} &amp; \\text{10421} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; \\text{7089} &amp; \\text{11380} &amp; \\text{18469} \\\\ \\end{array} } } \\] \\[ \\text { Strata Proportions } \\bbox[yellow,4px] { \\color{black} { \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\text{Gender} &amp; \\text{Undergraduate} &amp; \\text{Graduate} &amp; \\text{Total} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Female} &amp; \\text{3355/18469 = .182} &amp; \\text{.254} &amp; \\text{.436} \\\\ \\text{Male} &amp; \\text{.202} &amp; \\text{.362} &amp; \\text{.564} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; \\text{.384} &amp; \\text{.616} &amp; \\text{1.000} \\\\ \\end{array} } } \\] \\[ \\text { Sample sizes } \\bbox[lightblue,4px] { \\color{black} { \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\text{Gender} &amp; \\text{Undergraduate} &amp; \\text{Graduate} &amp; \\text{Total} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Female} &amp; \\text{.182(500)=91} &amp; \\text{127} &amp; \\text{218} \\\\ \\text{Male} &amp; \\text{101} &amp; \\text{181} &amp; \\text{282} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; \\text{192} &amp; \\text{308} &amp; \\text{500} \\\\ \\end{array} } } \\] Practice Design a sample to survey \\(1200\\) students using stratified sampling method. \\[ \\bbox[white,4px] { \\color{black} { \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\text{Gender} &amp; \\text{Undergraduate} &amp; \\text{Graduate} &amp; \\text{Professional} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Female} &amp; \\text{10588} &amp; \\text{4475} &amp; \\text{1421} \\\\ \\text{Male} &amp; \\text{7762} &amp; \\text{3736} &amp; \\text{1153} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } } \\] 2.4.3 Cluster Sampling The population is often divided into non-overlapping mutually homogeneous yet internally heterogeneous subgroups called clusters. Cluster sampling is much like SRS, but instead of randomly selecting individuals, SRS is applied to select clusters. In other words, unlike stratified sampling, cluster sampling is most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves dont look very different from one another. That is, we expect strata to be self-similar (homogeneous), while we expect clusters to be diverse (heterogeneous). The elements in each cluster are then sampled. If all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this is referred to as a one-stage cluster sampling plan. Sometimes cluster sampling can be a more economical random sampling technique than the alternatives. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, this sampling method works best when each neighborhood is very diverse. Because each neighborhood itself encompasses diversity, a cluster sample can reduce the time and cost associated with data collection, because the interviewer would need only go to some of the neighborhoods rather than to all parts of a city, in order to collect a useful sample. One-Stage Cluster Sampling Source: OpenIntro.Org Multistage Cluster Sampling A multistage or multistage cluster sampling is an extention of cluster sampling and involves two (or more) steps. First step is to take a cluster sample. Then, instead of including all of the individuals in these clusters in the sample, a second sampling method, usually SRS, is employed within each of the selected clusters. In the neighborhood example, we could first randomly select some number of neighborhoods and then take a SRS from just those selected neighborhoods. As seen in Figure, stratified sampling requires observations to be sampled from every stratum. Multistage sampling selects observations only from those clusters that were randomly selected in the first step. It is also possible to have more than two steps in multistage sampling. Each cluster may be naturally divided into subclusters. For example, each neighborhood could be divided into streets. To take a three-stage sample, we could first select some number of clusters (neighborhoods), and then, within the selected clusters, select some number of subclusters (streets). Finally, we could select some number of individuals from each of the selected streets. Source: OpenIntro.Org 2.4.4 Nonrandom Sampling Systematic Sampling Select every \\(k^{th}\\) individual from a list of the population, where the position of the first person chosen is randomly selected from the \\(k\\) individuals. This will give a non-representative sample if there is a structure to the list. Source: OpenIntro.Org Solve: The human resource department at a certain company wants to conduct a survey regarding worker benefits. The department has an alphabetical list of all \\(5465\\) employees at the company and wants to conduct a systematic sample of size \\(60\\). What is \\(k\\)? Convenience or Volunteer Sampling Use the first \\(n\\) individuals that are available or the individuals who volunteer to participate. This is almost sure to give a non-representative sample which cannot be generalized to the population. Exercise: Identifying Sampling Methods A researcher randomly selects 20 Taco Bell locations and surveys all the employees at those locations. A news station hosts a call-in survey about whether physician-assisted death should be legalized in all states. A researcher randomly selects an LED TV out of the first 200 LED TVs on an assembly line and also selects every 200th LED TV after that. In a study at a community college, 30 instructors are randomly selected from fulltime instructors and 50 instructors are selected from part-time instructors. The City Hall of Spring Hill, Kansas, creates a frame of its 5730 residents and randomly selects 60 residents. Example: Non-Representative Sample Survey Surveyed 10 million people who were subscribers or had telephones. 2.4 million people responded (i.e. 24% response rate) Prediction Landslide victory of Landon. Election Result Landslide victory of Roosevelt. What did go wrong with the poll? Sample was drawn from telephone directories, club membership, magazine subscibers, etc. who were upper middle class people, largely excluding poor unemployed people. The sample suffered from both selection and nonresponse bias. 2.5 Sampling Errors Statistical Inference Inferential Statistics is the practice of using information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population. It is the process of making judgments about the parameters of a population and the reliability of statistical relationships, typically on the basis of random sampling. \\(\\require{AMScd}\\) \\[ \\begin{CD} Sample @&gt; {\\text {statistical inference}} &gt;&gt; Population \\end{CD} \\] \\[\\underbrace{\\text {sample statistic}}_{\\text{investigator knows}} = \\underbrace{\\text {population parameter}}_{\\text{investigator wants to know}} + \\underbrace{\\text {bias}}_{\\text{nonsampling error}} + \\underbrace{\\text {chance variation}}_{\\text{random sampling error}} \\] Random Sampling Error - occurs when the sample has been selected with a random method, but there is a discrepancy between a sample result and the true population result. Non-sampling Error - is the results of human error, including such factors as wrong data entries, computing errors, questions with biased wording, false data provided by respondents, forming biased conclusions, or applying statistical methods that are not appropriate for the circumstances. A sampling method that consistently underestimates or overestimates some characteristics of the population is said to be biased. Selection/Sampling bias - occurs when the sample is selected in such a way that it systematically excludes or underrepresented part of the population. An online survey conducted to estimate the percentage of Americans who have a Facebook account. The survey is biased because people who go online are favored. People who never go online cannot participate in the poll. Nonresponse bias - occurs when responses are not obtained from all individuals selected for inclusion in a sample. It happens if individuals refuse to be part of the study or if the research cannot track down individuals identified to be in the sample. Measurement or response bias - occurs when the data are collected in such a way that it tends to result in observed values that are different from the actual value in some systematic way. Contributing factors: question wording and order; mode of survey; influence of the interviewer; people might exaggerate how much money they earn; or a researcher might record the information incorrectly etc. Response bias can also result from the wording of questions. For example, compare the impact of the following two questions: Do you brag about your past successes with others? Do you inspire others by sharing your past successes? Do you share your past successes with others? Nonrandom Sampling Error - is the results of using a sampling method that is not random, such as using a convenience sample or a voluntary response sample. 2.6 Bias and Precision Bias The average difference between the estimator and the true value. Precision The standard deviation of the estimator. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Mean Squared Error, MSE} &amp;= precision^2 + bias^2 \\\\ \\text{Root Mean Squared Error, RMSE} &amp;= \\sqrt{MSE} \\end{aligned} \\] Statistical Studies Explanatory and Response Variables In statistical studies, we want to know whether a variable \\(x\\) explains (or affects) another variables \\(y\\). The \\(x\\) variable is called the explanatory or independent variable. The \\(y\\) variable is called the response or dependent variable. Association vs. Causation There is an association between an explanatory and response variable when the response variable changes as the explanatory variable changes. If the change in the explanatory variable causes the change in the response variable, then there is a causation between the variables. 2.7 Observational Studies Generally, data in observational studies are collected on specific characteristics only by passively monitoring study participants, but the observers dont attempt to modify the individuals being studied. These studies are inexpensive and good for discovering relationships related to rare outcomes. They are generally only sufficient to show associations. Types of observational studies: 1. Cross-sectional Studies - data are observed, measured, and collected at one point in time, not over a period of time. 2. Retrospective Studies - data are collected from a past time period by going back in time (through examinations of records, interviews, and so on). 3. Prospective (or longitudinal or cohort) Studies - data are collected in the future from groups that share common factors (such groups are called cohorts).

Sample Size: 400,000 Age Range: 50-71 years Period: 1995 - 2008 Death: 52,000 How would you interpret the result? Confounding Variable A confounding variable is a variable that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables. Simultaneously with the explanatory variable, it may cause the response variable to change during the study. Because of the confounding variables association with both variables, we do not know if the response is due to the explanatory variable or due to the confounding variable. Sun exposure is a confounding factor because it is associated with both the use of sunscreen and the development of skin cancer. People who are out in the sun all day are more likely to use sunscreen, and people who are out in the sun all day are more likely to get skin cancer. Lurking Variable Lurking variables are variables that are not considered in the analysis, but may affect the nature of the relationship between the explanatory variable and the outcome.

In an experiment, we apply some treatment and then proceed to observe its effects on the individuals. Subject: Entity who is participating in the study. Treatment Group: The group of subjects that receives treatments. Control Group: The group of subjects that receives no treatment. Response Variable: The outcome of interest, measured on each subject. Factor: The categorical variable that explains the outcome of the experiment. Each category is called level. Blinding: When researchers keep the subjects uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be blind. Its purpose is to reduce the potential for both researchers and subjects emotional bias. Subjects would not know which experimental group they are assigned to. The researcher (i.e. the person who is measuring the outcome) would not know which treatment is assigned to which experimental unit. Single-blind: only one type of blinding is applied. Double-blind: both types of blinding are applied. Placebo: A substance or treatment with no active ingredients. The control group receives the placebo treatment. This phenomenon, in which the recipient perceives an improvement in condition due to personal expectations, rather than the treatment itself, is known as the placebo effect. Principles of Experimental Design Well-conducted experiments are built on three main principles. Direct Control Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to control any other differences in the groups. They want the groups to be as identical as possible except for the treatment, so that at the end of the experiment any difference in response between the groups can be attributed to the treatment and not to some other confounding or lurking variable. Direct control refers to variables that the researcher can control. Randomization Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out the effects of such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study. Replication In a single study, replication is done by imposing the treatment on a sufficiently large number of subjects or experimental units. Scientists may also replicate the entire experiment on an entirely different population of experimental units to verify earlier findings. 2.8.1 Randomized Blocked Design Researchers sometimes know or suspect that another variable, other than the treatment, influences the response. Under these circumstances, they may carry out a blocked experiment. In this design, they first group individuals into blocks based on the identified variable (in other words, form blocks or groups of subjects with similar characteristics) and then randomize subjects within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is referred to as blocking. For example, blocks can be designed based on gender or age group of subjects. 2.8.2 Completely Randomized Experimental Design A completely randomized experimental design is one in which the subjects or experimental units are randomly assigned to each group in the experiment.

Individuals should be randomly assigned to the control and treatment group(s). The sample size should be large enough. A placebo should be used when appropriate. The study should be double-blind when possible. If this is impossible, then the study should be single-blind if possible. Practice: Identifying an Experiment and an Observational Study Identify whether the study is an experiment or an observational study. Discuss whether the components of a good study were used. For five years, the author taught an innovative intermediate algebra course in which students learned by working in groups. Then the author compared the proportion of his successful intermediate algebra students who passed trigonometry with the proportion of other professors successful intermediate algebra students who passed trigonometry. Practice: Redesign an Observational Study into a Well-Designed Experiment A researcher wants to determine whether taking vitamin C helps people avoid getting the flu and the common cold. She randomly selects 100 people and asks them whether they take vitamin C and how often they had the flu or a cold in the past year. The researcher analyzes the responses and concludes that vitamin C helps people avoid the flu and colds. Describe some problems with the observational study. Include in your description at least one possible lurking or confounding variable and identify which type it is. Redesign the study so that it is a well-designed experiment.

The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values; and the vertical scale represents frequencies. A relative frequency histogram has the same shape and horizontal scale as a histogram, but the vertical scale uses relative frequencies (as percentages) instead of actual frequencies. Importance of Histogram Visually displays the shape of the distribution of the data Shows the location of the center of the data Shows the spread of the data Identifies outliers Density Histogram \\[ \\begin{align} \\textbf{Density} &amp;= \\dfrac{\\textbf{relative frequency}}{\\textbf{bin width}} \\\\ \\text {Density of class (75-124)} &amp;= \\dfrac{\\text{rel. freq of class (75-124)}}{\\text{class width}} \\\\ &amp;= \\dfrac{0.22}{50} \\\\ &amp;= 0.0044 \\end{align} \\] In density histogram, area of each rectangular bar is the relative frequency of its class.

The higher the stack of dots, the greater the number of occurrences there are of the corresponding value. Pie Charts The distribution of a categorical variable can be described by a pie chart, which is a disk where slices represent the categories. The proportion of the total area for one slice is equal to the relative frequency for the category represented by the slice. The relative frequencies are usually written as percentages.

Interpreting a Multiple Bar Graph In a survey in 2012, 1960 adults were asked the following question: Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, Democrat, Independent, or other? The results of the survey are described by the multiple bar graph. What proportion of women thought of themselves as Democrats? Which political party did the greatest proportion of men choose? Compare the proportion of women who thought of themselves as Independents to the proportion of men who thought of themselves as Independents. A total of 1081 women and 879 men responded to the survey. Were there more women or men who thought of themselves as Independents? How is this possible, given there was a smaller proportion of women who thought of themselves as Independents than men?

Interpret quantitative data using graphs and descriptive statistics with emphasis on histograms and boxplots. In this chapter, we will numerically describe distributions of quantitative variables. Distributions, such as histograms, can be described by three characteristics: shape, center, and spread. 4.1 Measures of Shape Modes The mode of some data is an observation with the greatest frequency. There can be more than one mode, but if all the observations have frequency 1, then there is no mode. Mode is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. Unimodel Distribution Bimodal Distribution Multimodal Distribution Uniform Distribution All the bins have the same frequency, or at least close to the same frequency. It is a distribution without a mode. Symmetry The histogram for a symmetric distribution will look the same on the left and the right of its center. Skew A histogram is skewed right if the longer tail is on the right side of the mode. A histogram is skewed left if the longer tail is on the left side of the mode. Outlier An Outlier is a data value that is far above or far below the rest of the data values. 4.2 Measures of Center Mean The sample mean of a numerical variable is computed as the sum of all of the observations \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}\\) divided by the number of observations \\((n)\\). If \\(\\bar x\\) is the mean, then \\[ \\displaystyle (\\bar x - x_1) + (\\bar x - x_2) + \\cdots + (\\bar x - x_n) = 0 \\\\ \\displaystyle \\text{Therefore}, \\ \\bar x = \\frac{(x_1+x_2+...+x_n)}{n} = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\] The mean follows the tail In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. In a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. In a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are approximately equal. Median The median splits an ordered data set in half. If there are an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. If there are an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 7 7 7 9 9 9 10 10 10 11 11 12 14 14 16 17 22 25 25 25 26 26 27 29 42 43 64 Calculating the Median \\(n\\) is odd Sort the series in ascending order.

How the Shape of a Distribution Affects the Mean and the Median If a distribution is skewed left, the mean is usually less than the median and the median is usually a better measure of the center. If a distribution is symmetric, the mean is approximately equal to the median and both are reasonable measures of the center. If a distribution is skewed right, the mean is usually greater than the median and the median is usually a better measure of the center. List: \\({2,3,3,4}\\) List: \\(2,3,3,7\\) \\(\\textbf {Notice: The median is unaffected by outliers.}\\) Weighted Mean The weighted mean is the same as the mean, except that it is influenced more by some observations than others. We assign weights to observations as a sort of way of describing its relative importance. The weighted mean of observations \\(x_1, x_2,...,x_n\\) using weights \\(w_1, w_2,...,w_n\\) is given by \\(\\displaystyle \\bar x =\\frac{w_1x_1+w_2x_2+...+w_nx_n}{w_1+w_2+...+w_n}\\) The simple mean is a weighted mean where all the weights are 1. \\(\\displaystyle \\bar x =\\frac{1\\times x_1+1\\times x_2+...+1\\times x_n}{1+1+...+1} = \\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}\\) Calculating Mean from a Frequency Distribution \\[ \\bar x = \\dfrac{\\sum (f \\cdot x)}{\\sum f} \\] where, \\(f\\) is the class frequency and \\(x\\) is the class midpoint. \\[ \\bbox[white,4px] { \\color{black} { \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\text{Time(Seconds)} &amp; \\text{Frequency } f &amp; \\text{Class Midpoint } x &amp; f \\cdot x \\\\ \\hline \\text{75-124} &amp; 11 &amp; 99.5 &amp; 1094.5 \\\\ \\text{125-174} &amp; 24 &amp; 149.5 &amp; 3588.0 \\\\ \\text{175-224} &amp; 10 &amp; 199.5 &amp; 1995.0 \\\\ \\text{225-274} &amp; 3 &amp; 249.5 &amp; 748.5 \\\\ \\text{275-324} &amp; 2 &amp; 299.5 &amp; 599.0 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Total} &amp; \\sum f = 50 &amp; &amp; \\sum(f \\cdot x) = 8025.0 \\\\ \\end{array} } } \\] \\[ \\displaystyle \\bar x = \\dfrac{\\sum (f \\cdot x)}{\\sum f} = \\dfrac{8025.0}{50} = 160.5 \\] Midrange The midrange of a data set is the measure of center that is the value midway between the maximum and minimum values in the original data set. It is found by adding the maximum data value to the minimum data value and then dividing the sum by \\(2\\), as the following formula: \\[ \\text {Midrange} = \\dfrac{\\text{maximum data value + minimum data value}}{2} \\] 4.3 Measures of Spread or Variation Range The range of a set of data is the difference between the maximum and the minimum data values. \\(\\textbf {range = maximum - minimum}\\) The range is sensitive to outliers. A single high or low value will affect the range significantly. Standard Deviation of a Sample SD \\((s)\\) of a set of sample values is a measure of how much, on average, the data values deviate away from the sample mean. In other word, SD describes the variability of the data set within the range of the dataset. Low variability or small spread means that the values tend to be more clustered together. High variability or large spread means that the values tend to be far apart. Calculating the Standard Deviation The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is roughly the average distance of the observations from the mean. \\[ \\bbox[yellow,5px] { \\color{black}{s= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum(x_i-\\bar x)^2}} } \\] Exercise: \\(1.

Sample variance: \\(s^2 =\\) square of the sample standard deviation \\(s\\). Population variance: \\(\\sigma^2 =\\) square of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Why is \\((n-1)\\) used to calculate standard deviation? \\(s` = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum(x_i-\\bar x)^2}\\) is not an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), meaning that the distribution of \\(s\\) does not tend to center around \\(\\sigma\\). Therefore, an adjustment is applied by replacing \\(n\\) by \\((n-1)\\) in the denominator. \\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum(x_i-\\bar x)^2}\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma\\). Also, with division by \\(n-1\\), sample variance \\(s^2\\) tend to center around the value of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\); with division by \\(n\\), sample variances \\(s^2\\) tend to underestimate the value of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Coefficient of Variation The coefficient of variation (CV) for a set of non-negative sample or population data, expressed as a percent, describes the standard deviation relative to the mean, and is given by the following: \\[ Sample: CV = \\frac{s}{x}.100 \\\\ Population: CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{x}.100 \\] 4.4 Normal Distribution and Standard Deviation Probabilities for falling 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.

The \\(z\\) score is calculated by using one of the following: \\[z= \\dfrac{x-\\bar x}{s}\\] \\[ \\begin{align} x = \\bar x - 2s &amp;\\implies z = -2 \\\\ x = \\bar x - s &amp;\\implies z = -1 \\\\ x = \\bar x &amp;\\implies z = 0 \\\\ x = \\bar x + s &amp;\\implies z = +1 \\\\ x = \\bar x + 2s &amp;\\implies z = +2 \\\\ \\end{align} \\] Note: \\(z\\)-score is useful in comparing two variables measured on different scales. Example: The \\(4000\\) g weight of a newborn baby (among 400 weighs with sample mean \\(\\bar x = 3152.0\\) g and sample standard deviation \\(s = 693.4\\) g) \\[ z = \\dfrac{x - \\bar x}{s} = \\dfrac{4000 - 3152.0}{693.4} = 1.22 \\] The weight \\(4000\\) g is \\(1.22\\) standard deviations away from the mean. 4.5 Percentiles and Quartiles Percentiles are measures of location, denoted \\(P_1, P_2, \\cdots, P_{99}\\), which divide a set of data into \\(100\\) groups with about \\(1\\%\\) of the values in each group. Example - the \\(50\\)th percentile, denoted \\(P_{50}\\) has about \\(50\\%\\) of the data values below it and about \\(50\\%\\) of the data value above it. The \\(n^{th}\\) percentile is the data value such that \\(n\\) percent of the data lies below that value and \\((100-n)\\) percent of the data falls above that value. \\[ \\text{Percentile of value } x = \\frac{\\text{number of values less than } x}{\\text{total number of values}} \\times 100 \\] Finding a Percentile \\(\\text {Table: Data Speeds (mbps) at Various Airports}\\) Find the percentile for the data of 11.8 mbps.

This means \\(40\\%\\) of the airports reported data speeds less than \\(11.8\\) mbps. Find the 40th percentile. First, compute the locator, \\(L = \\dfrac{k}{100} \\cdot n = \\dfrac{40}{100} \\cdot 50 = 20.\\) By definition, \\(P_{40}\\) below which \\(40\\%\\) of the data points fall. Hence, the \\(40\\)th percentile is midway between the \\(20\\)th and \\(21\\)st value. In the table above, \\(20th\\) value is \\(11.6\\) and \\(21\\)st value is \\(11.8\\), so the midway between them is \\(11.7\\) mbps. \\(\\therefore P_{40} = 11.7\\) mbps. Find the 25th percentile. \\(L = \\dfrac{k}{100} \\cdot n = \\dfrac{25}{100} \\cdot 50 = 12.5.\\) In this case, we round up the value of \\(L\\) to get \\(13\\) to make sure at least \\(12.5\\%\\) data points fall below that point. \\(\\therefore P_{25} = 7.9\\) mbps. Three Quartiles \\((Q_1, Q_2, Q_3)\\) \\(Q_1\\) represents the first quartile, which is the 25th percentile, and is the median of the smaller half of the data set. \\(Q_2\\) represents the second quartile, which is equivalent to the 50th percentile (i.e. the median). \\(Q_3\\) represents the third quartile, or 75th percentile, and is the median of the larger half of the data set Interquartile Range \\((IQR) = Q_3 - Q_1\\) 4.6 Boxplot 5-Number Summary For a set of data, the 5-number summary consists of five values: minimum first quartile, \\(Q_1\\) second quartile (median), \\(Q_2\\) third quartile, \\(Q_3\\) Maximum A boxplot (or box-and-whisker diagram) is a graph of a data set that consists of a line extending from the minimum value to the maximum value, and a box with lines drawn at the first quartile \\((Q_1)\\), the median \\((Q_2)\\), and the third quartile \\((Q_3)\\).

In this chapter, we will extend the concept of relative frequencies to understand and calculate the probability of occurrence of a random event. We will also learn about normal distribution, its properties, and methods to calculate probabilities of random events that are described by this distribution. 5.1 Definitions An event is any collection of results or outcomes of a procedure. For example, tossing a coin is an event with possible outcomes heads and tails. A simple event is an event that has one outcome. For example, births of \\(2\\) girls followed by a boy is a simple event because the only possible outcome is \\(\\{ggb\\}\\). However, births of \\(2\\) girls and a boy is an event that has three possible outcomes \\(\\{ggb, gbg, bgg \\}\\). A sample space for a procedure consists of all possible simple events. For example, with births of three children, the sample space consists of eight different simple events \\(\\{ bbb, bbg, bgb, bgg, gbb, gbg, ggb, ggg\\}\\) An event is random if individual outcomes of it are unpredictable, meaning they have no apparent pattern of occurrence, but there is nonetheless a predictable distribution (i.e. the frequencies) of those different outcomes over a large number of repetitions of the event. The probability of any outcome of a random event can be defined as the proportion of times the outcome would occur in a very long series of repetitions. The probability is defined as a proportion, and it always takes values between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) (inclusively). It may also be displayed as a percentage between \\(0\\%\\) and \\(100\\%\\). \\(0\\%: \\text{event is impossible}\\) \\(100\\%: \\text{event is certain}\\) THEORETICAL VERSUS EXPERIMENTAL PROBABILITY The Theoretical probability is the likelihood of occurring of an event. It is simply the ratio of the number of desired outcomes and the number of all possible outcomes. The experimental probability is an estimate of the likelihood of occurring of an event based on repeated trials. The subjective probability is an estimate of the likelihood of occurring of an event based on someones belief. LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS Consider: Rolling a 1 of a die If the sample space of a random experiment consists of \\(n\\) equally likely outcomes and an event \\(E\\) consists of \\(m\\) of those outcomes, then \\[\\text {Theorerical Probability} : P(E) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes in the event}(m)}{\\text{total number of outcomes}(n)}\\] Let \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) be the proportion of outcomes that are \\(1\\) after the \\(n\\) rolls. As the number of rolls \\((n)\\) increases, \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) (the relative frequency of rolls, or the experimental probability) will converge to the theoretical probability of rolling a \\(1,\\space p = 1/6.\\) The figure shows the convergence for \\(100,000\\) die rolls. The tendency of \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) to stabilize around \\(p\\), i.e. the tendency of the relative frequency to stabilize around the true probability, is described by the Law of Large Numbers. As more observations are collected, the observed proportion \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) of occurrences with a particular outcome after \\(n\\) trials converges to the true probability \\(p\\) of that outcome. Die Rolls Simulation The figure shows the fraction of die rolls that are \\(1\\) at each stage in a simulation. The relative frequency tends to get closer to the probability \\(1/6 \\approx 0.167\\) as the number of rolls increases. Example: Calculating Classical Probabilities Assuming that births of boys and girls are equally likely, find the probability of getting children of all of the same gender when three children are born.

When rolling a die, the outcomes \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are disjoint, and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities: \\[P(1 \\text{ or } 2)=P(1)+P(2)=1/6+1/6=1/3\\] What about the probability of rolling a \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\ or \\ 6\\) ? \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} P(1 \\text{ or } 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\text{ or } 4 \\text{ or } 5 \\text{ or }6) = P(1)+P(2)+P(3)+P(4)+P(5)+P(6) \\\\ =1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6 =1 \\end{array} \\] It is no surprise that the probability is \\(1\\), since it is certain that one of the six outcomes must occur. ADDITION RULE OF DISJOINT OUTCOMES If \\(A_1,...,A_k\\) represent \\(k\\) disjoint outcomes, then the probability that one of them occurs is given by: \\[P(A_1\\text{ or }A_2 \\text{ or ... or }A_k)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+...+P(A_k)\\] Example: Consider a standard deck of cards. \\[ \\text {4 suits} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{hearts: } \\color{red}{\\heartsuit} \\\\ \\text{diamonds: } \\color{red}{\\diamondsuit} \\\\ \\text{clubs: } \\spadesuit \\\\ \\text{spades: } \\clubsuit \\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[\\text{13 cards in each suit: } Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King\\] One card is dealt from a well shuffled deck. \\[ \\begin{align} P(\\text{the card is an ace or a king}) &amp;= P(\\text{it&#39;s an ace})+P(\\text {it&#39;s a king}) \\\\ &amp; = 4/52+4/52 \\\\ &amp; = 8/52 \\\\ &amp; = 2/13 \\end{align} \\] Venn Diagram - a diagram style to illustrate simple set relationships in probability.

It has a single numerical value, determined by chance, for each outcome of an event. We often use a capital letter such as \\(X\\) to stand for a random variable. Let \\(X\\) be a random variable representing all possible outcomes of rolling a six-sided die once. Find the given probability: \\(1. P(X=4)\\) \\(2. P(X\\le 4)\\) \\(3. P(X&gt;4)\\) \\(4. P(3 \\le X \\le 6)\\) A discrete random variable has a collection of values that is finite or countable, such as number of tosses of a coin before getting heads. A continuous random variable has infinitely many values, and the collection of values is not countable, such as body temperature. A probability distribution is a description that gives the probability for each value of the random variable. It can be expressed as a table or graph, or formula. Probability Distribution: Requirements There is a numerical (not categorical) random variable \\(x\\), and its number values are associated with corresponding probabilities. \\(\\sum P(x)=1\\), where \\(x\\) assumes all possible values. \\(0 \\le P(x) \\le 1\\) for every individual value of the random variable \\(x\\). \\[ \\begin{array}{c|lcr} \\text{x: number of heads} \\\\ \\text {when two coins are tossed} &amp; P(x) \\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 0.25 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0.50 \\\\ 2 &amp; 0.25 \\end{array} \\] Find the probability of getting two heads out of two tosses? Find the probability of getting at least one head out of two tosses? Find the probability of getting at most one head out of two tosses? 5.4 Parameters of a Probability Distribution Mean \\(\\mu\\) of a probability distribution \\(\\mu = \\sum [x \\cdot P(x)]\\) Variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) for a probability distribution \\(\\sigma^2 = \\sum[(x-\\mu)^2 \\cdot P(x)] = \\sum[x^2 \\cdot P(x)]-\\mu^2\\) Standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) for a probability distribution \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum[x^2 \\cdot P(x)]-\\mu^2}\\) Expected Value In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided die is \\(3.5\\), because the average of all the numbers that come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to \\(3.5\\). The law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values. In other words, each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value. The same principle applies to an absolutely continuous random variable, except that an integral of the variable with respect to its probability density replaces the sum. The expected value is a key aspect of how one characterizes a probability distribution; it is one type of location parameter. By contrast, the variance is a measure of dispersion of the possible values of the random variable around the expected value. The variance itself is defined in terms of two expectations: it is the expected value of the squared deviation of the variables value from the variables expected value. Expected value of a discrete random variable If \\(X\\) takes outcomes \\(x_1, x_2,\\cdots,x_m\\) with probabilities \\(p_1, p_2,\\cdots, p_m\\) the expected value of \\(X\\) is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its corresponding probability: \\[ \\begin{align} E(X) &amp;= \\mu_X = x_1 \\times p_1 + x_2 \\times p_2 +\\cdots+x_m \\times p_m \\\\ &amp;= \\sum^{m}_{i=0}(x_i \\times p_i) \\end{align} \\] Example: \\(\\text{ Random Variable } X: \\text{the number of spots on one roll of a die}\\) Probability distribution table for \\(X\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c} x &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\\\\ \\hline P(x) &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 \\end{array} \\] \\[ E(X) = 1 \\cdot (1/6) + 2 \\cdot (1/6) + 3 \\cdot (1/6) + 4 \\cdot (1/6) + 5 \\cdot (1/6) + 6 \\cdot (1/6) = 3.5 \\] Variability in Discrete Random Variables Variance and standard deviation of a discrete random variable If \\(X\\) takes outcomes \\(x_1, x_2, \\cdots ,x_m\\) with probabilities \\(p_1, p_2, \\cdots ,p_m\\) and expected value \\(\\mu_x = E(X),\\) then to find the standard deviation of \\(X\\), we first find the variance and then take its square root. \\[ \\begin{align} Var(X)=\\sigma^2_x &amp;= (x_1 - \\mu_x)^2 \\times p_1 + (x_2 - \\mu_x)^2 \\times p_2 + \\cdots + (x_m - \\mu_x)^2 \\times p_m \\\\ &amp;= \\sum^m_{i=1}(x_i-\\mu_x)^2 \\times p_i \\\\ \\\\ SD(X) = \\sigma_x &amp;= \\sqrt{\\sum^m_{i=1}(x_i-\\mu_x)^2 \\times p_i} \\\\ \\\\ \\text {From the above example, } \\\\ \\\\ Var(X)=\\sigma^2_x &amp;= [(1 - 3.5)^2 + (2 - 3.5)^2 + \\cdots + (6 - 3.5)^2]\\times (1/6) \\\\ &amp;= 2.92 \\\\ \\\\ SD(X) = \\sigma_x &amp;= \\sqrt{2.92} = 1.71 \\end{align} \\] Exercise 1: Coin Toss \\[ \\begin{array}{c|lcr} x \\text{: number of heads} \\\\ \\text {when two coins are tossed} &amp; P(x) \\\\ \\hline 0 &amp; 0.25 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0.50 \\\\ 2 &amp; 0.25 \\end{array} \\] Calculate expected value/average number of heads and SD from three tosses.

However, both games will generate profit for the casino owner. 5.5 Binomial Probability Distribution A binomial probability distribution results from a procedure that meets the following requirements: The procedure has a fixed number of trials (A trial is a single observation). The trials must be independent, meaning that the outcome of any individual trial doesnt affect the probabilities in the other trials. Each trial must have all outcomes classified into exactly two categories, commonly referred to as success and failure. The probability of a success remains the same in all trials.

In this chapter, we will use sample data to estimate values of population parameters (such as a population proportions or population mean). We will learn how to construct a confidence interval estimate of a population proportion and interpret such confidence interval estimates. Finally, we will learn how to determine the sample size necessary to estimate a population proportion. 7.1 Estimate a Population Proportion This section presents methods for using a sample proportion \\((\\hat p)\\) to make an inference about the value of the corresponding population proportion \\((p)\\). Point Estimate A point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter. For example, the sample proportion \\(\\hat p\\) is the best point estimate (also called unbiased estimator) of the population proportion \\(p\\). Unbiased Estimator: An unbiased estimator is a statistic that targets the value of the corresponding population parameter in the sense that the sampling distribution of the statistic has a mean that is equal to the corresponding population parameter. For example, the statistic \\(\\hat p\\) targets the population proportion \\(p\\), \\(E(\\mathbf {\\hat p} ) = p.\\) Also, \\(\\hat p\\) is the consistent estimator of \\(p\\) because as the sample size \\(n\\) increases to indefinitely, the resulting sequences of \\(\\hat p\\) converges in probability to \\(p\\). Consistent Estimator \\({T_1, T_2, T_3, ...}\\) is a sequence of estimators for parameter \\(\\theta_0\\), the true value of which is \\(4\\). This sequence is consistent: the estimators are getting more and more concentrated near the true value \\(\\theta_0\\). The limiting distribution of the sequence is a degenerate random variable which equals \\(\\theta_0\\) with probability \\(1\\). An unbiased estimator can be inconsistent - meaning its expected value is equal to the population parameter, but it does not consistently converge to any value as \\(n\\) increases. On the other hand, a consistent estimator can be biased - meaning it consistently converges to the correct population parameter, but its expected value is higher or lower than the targeted value. Source: Wikipedia 7.2 Confidence Intervals A point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible range of values for the parameter. A confidence interval or (interval estimate) is a range (or an interval) of values used to estimate the true value of a population parameter. A confidence interval is sometimes abbreviated as CI. The confidence level is the probability \\(1-\\alpha\\) (such as \\(0.95\\), or \\(95\\%\\)) that the confidence interval actually does contain the population parameter, assuming that the estimate process is repeated a large number of times. (The confidence level is also called the degree of confidence, or the confidence coefficient.) \\(\\alpha : \\text { significance level }\\) Constructing a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as normal, the point estimate we observe will be within \\(1.96\\) standard errors of the true value of interest about \\(95\\%\\) of the time. Thus, a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for such a point estimate can be constructed: \\(\\text {point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE\\) 95% confidence interval Critical Value The values of the \\(z\\) scores at the borderlines of the confidence interval are called the critical values. Critical Value Example: Find the critical value \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) corresponding to a \\(95\\%\\) confidence level. \\[ \\begin{array} {|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Confidence Level} &amp; \\alpha &amp; \\text{Critical Value, } z_{\\alpha/2} \\\\ \\hline 90\\% &amp; 0.1 &amp; 1.645 \\\\ \\hline 95\\% &amp; 0.05 &amp; 1.960 \\\\ \\hline 99\\% &amp; 0.01 &amp; 2.575 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\] Generalizing Confidence Interval If the point estimate follows the normal model with standard error \\(SE\\), then a confidence interval for the population parameter is \\[ \\text {point estimate} \\pm z{^{\\star}_{\\alpha/2}} \\times SE \\] where \\(z^\\star\\) , the critical value, depends on the confidence level (\\(CL\\)) selected, and \\(\\alpha = 1-CL\\) Calculating Confidence Intervals Example: The heart patients who receive stents are \\(9\\%\\) more likely to suffer stroke from usage of the stent than those who do not have it. The estimates standard error \\((SE)\\) is \\(0.028\\). Construct a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the change in strole rates from the usage of stent. \\[ \\begin{align} \\text {95% Confidence Interval} &amp;= \\text {point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE \\\\ &amp;= 0.090 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.028 \\\\ &amp;=(0.035, 0.145) \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} \\text {90% Confidence Interval} &amp;= \\text {point estimate} \\pm 1.645 \\times SE \\\\ &amp;= 0.090 \\pm 1.645 \\times 0.028 \\\\ &amp;=(0.044, 0.136) \\end{align} \\] Simulating Confidence Intervals \\(50\\) samples of size \\(n = 300\\) were drawn from a population with proportion parameter \\(p = 0.30\\). For each sample, a confidence interval was created to capture the true proportion \\(p\\). How many did not capture \\(p = 0.30?\\) Interpretation of Confidence Intervals Suppose, the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval estimate of the population proportion \\(p\\) is \\(0.405 \\lt p \\lt 0.455\\). \\(\\textbf {Correct }\\) We are \\(95\\%\\) confident that the interval from \\(0.405\\) to \\(0.455\\) actually does contain the true value of the population proportion \\(p\\). \\(\\textbf {Wrong }\\) There is a \\(95\\%\\) chance that the true value of the population proportion \\(p\\) will fall between \\(0.405\\) to \\(0.455\\). 7.2.1 Margin of Error (ME) The margin of error (ME) is the distance between the point estimate and the lower or upper bound of a confidence interval. \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{confidence interval} &amp;= \\text {point estimate} \\pm z{^{\\star}_{\\alpha/2}} \\times SE \\\\ &amp;= \\text {point estimate} \\pm \\text{margin of error} \\end{align} \\] 7.3 Finding the Sample Size to Estimate a Population Proportion We assume that the sampling distribution of sample proportion follows a normal distribution, which allows us to use critical \\(z\\) score to determine the sample size from a given margin of error and confidence level. Example: A pilot study showed that \\(0.5\\%\\) of credit card offers in the mail end up with the person signing up. To be within \\(0.1\\%\\) of the true rate with \\(95\\%\\) confidence, how big does the test mailing have to be? \\[ \\begin{align} ME &amp;= z{^{\\star}_{\\alpha/2}} \\times SE \\\\ ME &amp;= z{^{\\star}_{\\alpha/2}} \\times \\sqrt \\frac{\\hat p \\hat q}{n} \\\\ 0.001 &amp;= 1.96 \\times \\sqrt \\frac{(0.005)(0.995)}{n} \\\\ (0.001)^2 &amp;= (1.96)^2 \\times \\frac{(0.005)(0.995)}{n} \\\\ n &amp;= (1.96)^2 \\times \\frac{(0.005)(0.995)}{(0.001)^2} \\\\ n &amp;= 19112 \\end{align} \\] 7.4 Estimating a Population Mean The main goal of this section is to make an inference about the population mean \\((\\mu)\\) from the mean \\((\\bar x)\\) of a sample drawn from the same population. Therefore, \\(\\bar x\\) is the point estimate of the population \\(\\mu\\). 7.4.1 Estimating a Population Mean When \\(\\sigma\\) Is Known It is extremely rare that we want to estimate an unknown value of a population mean \\(\\mu\\) but we somehow know the value of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). If we somehow do know the value of \\(\\sigma\\), the confidence interval is constructed using the standard normal distribution. Confidence interval estimate of the true population mean \\(\\mu\\): \\[ ME = z_{\\alpha/2}.\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\text { ; use with known } \\sigma \\] \\[ n = 15, \\bar x = 30.9, \\sigma = 2.9, CL = 95\\% \\\\ ME = 1.96.\\frac{2.9}{\\sqrt{15}} = 1.46760 \\\\ \\bar x - ME &lt; \\mu &lt; \\bar x + ME \\\\ 30.9 - 1.46760 &lt; \\mu &lt; 30.9 + 1.46760 \\\\ 29.4 &lt; \\mu &lt; 32.4 \\] 7.4.2 Estimating a Population Mean When \\(\\sigma\\) Is Not Known \\(\\text {The sample mean } \\bar x \\text { is the best estimate of the population mean } \\mu.\\) Normality: The method for finding a confidence interval estimate of \\(\\mu\\) is robust against a departure from normality, which means that the normality requirement is relaxed. The distribution need not be perfectly normal, but it has to be symmetric with one mode. In this case, population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is estimated from the sample. The sampling distribution employed to calculate the confidence interval of \\(\\mu\\) from sample mean \\(\\bar x\\) is called \\(\\text{Student } t \\text{ Distribution}.\\) \\(\\text {Student } t- \\text { Distribution}\\) According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of a statistic (e.g. sample mean) will follow a normal distribution, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large \\((n&gt;30)\\). But sample sizes are sometimes small, and often we do not know the standard deviation of the population. When either of these occurs, statisticians rely on the distribution of the \\(\\text {t-statistic (t-score)}\\) with the degrees of freedom \\((n-1)\\), \\(t = \\dfrac {\\bar x - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt n}\\) \\(\\text{Degrees of Freedom} = n - 1\\) \\(\\text {t-distribution }\\) is determined by its degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom refers to the number of independent observations in a set of data. Properties of the \\(t \\text {-Distribution:}\\) The \\(\\text {Student } t\\) distribution has the same general symmetric shape as the standard normal distribution, but with more variability, which is typical of sampling distributions used for small sample size. As the sample size \\(n\\) gets larger, the \\(t\\) distribution gets closer to the standard normal distribution. The mean of the distribution is equal to \\(0\\). Unlike the variance of the standard normal distribution \\((\\sigma^2 = 1)\\), The variance of \\(t\\) distribution depends on the sample size \\((n)\\) and is equal to \\(\\frac {v}{v-2}\\), where \\(v\\) is the DF and \\(v \\ge 2\\). 7.4.3 \\(t \\text { Confidence Interval}\\) Find a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for mirex concentrations in salmon. \\[ \\begin{align} n &amp;= 150 \\\\ \\bar x &amp;= 0.0913 \\space ppm \\\\ s &amp;= 0.0495 \\space ppm \\\\ df &amp;= 150 - 1 = 149 \\\\ \\\\ SE(\\bar x) &amp;= \\frac{0.0495}{\\sqrt{150}} = 0.0040 \\\\ t^*_{149} &amp;= 1.976 \\\\ \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\text {Confidence Interval of } \\bar x: \\\\ &amp;\\bar x \\pm t^*_{149} \\times SE(\\bar x) \\\\ &amp;= 0.0913 \\pm 1.976 \\times 0.0040 \\\\ &amp;= 0.0913 \\pm 0.0079 \\\\ &amp;= (0.0834, 0.0992) \\end{align} \\] 7.4.4 Finding the Sample Size to Estimate a Population Mean Should you buy a movie download accelerator? To test the download times, find the minimum number of downloads that you need to do during a free trial period to obtain a \\(95\\%\\) CL with a ME &lt; \\(8\\) minutes. Given, \\(\\sigma = 10 \\space min\\) First, calculate \\(n\\) using \\(z-score\\) \\[ \\begin{align} ME &amp;&lt; 8 \\\\ \\\\ \\text {with } z^* &amp;= 2 \\text { at 95% CL} \\\\ \\\\ 2 \\times \\frac {10}{\\sqrt n} &amp;&lt; 8 \\\\ n &amp;&gt; 6.25 \\\\ n &amp;\\approx 7 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{align} \\] Sample size turns out to be too small for normal approximation. Therefore, re-estimate \\(n\\) using \\(t-score\\). Second, find the critical value of \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\) corresponding to a \\(95\\%\\) confidence level, given that \\(n = 6\\). \\[ \\begin{align} df &amp;= 7 - 1 = 6 \\\\ \\\\ \\text {with } t^*_6 &amp;= 2.447 \\text { at 95% CL} \\\\ \\\\ 2.447 \\times \\frac {10}{\\sqrt n} &amp;&lt; 8 \\\\ n &amp;&gt; 9.36 \\\\ n &amp;\\approx 10 \\\\ \\\\ \\end{align} \\] Hence, at least 10 trial downloads need to be run to make sure ME remains less than \\(8\\) min.

Point Estimate: The sample variance \\(s^2\\) is the best point estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The sample standard deviation \\(s\\) is commonly used as a point estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), even though it is a biased estimator. Confidence Interval: When constructing a confidence interval estimate of a population standard deviation (or population variance), we construct the confidence interval using the \\(\\chi^2 \\text{ distribution}\\). 7.5 Chi-Squared \\(\\chi^2\\) Distribution In a normally distributed population with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), if we randomly select independent samples of size \\(n\\) and, for each sample, compute the sample variance \\(s^2\\), the sample statistic \\(\\chi^2 = (n -1)s^2/{\\sigma^2}\\) has sampling distribution called the chi-squared distribution, \\[ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma^2} \\] \\(\\text{Degrees of freedom: df } = n -1\\) \\(\\chi^2 \\text{ distribution }\\) is skewed to the right, unlike normal and student \\(t\\) distributions. \\(\\chi^2 \\ge 0\\) The chi-squared distribution is different for each number of degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increases, chi-squared distribution approaches a normal distribution. 7.5.1 Confidence Interval for Estimating a Population Standard Deviation or Variance Confidence Interval for the Population Variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\[ \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_L} &lt; \\sigma^2 &lt; \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_R} \\] Confidence Interval for the Population Variance \\(\\sigma\\) \\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_L}} &lt; \\sigma &lt; \\sqrt{\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_R}} \\] 7.5.2 Confidence Interval for Estimating a Population Standard Deviation or Variance \\[ \\begin{align} &amp;s = 14.29263 \\\\ &amp;n = 22 \\\\ &amp;CL = 95\\% \\\\ \\\\ &amp;\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_L} &lt; \\sigma^2 &lt; \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_R} \\\\ \\\\ &amp;\\frac{21.(14.29263)^2}{10.283^2} &lt; \\sigma^2 &lt; \\frac{21.(14.29263)^2}{35.479^2} \\\\ \\\\ &amp;120.9 &lt; \\sigma^2 &lt; 417.2 \\\\ &amp;11.0 &lt; \\sigma &lt; 20.4 \\end{align} \\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
